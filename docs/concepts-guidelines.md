## Terminology

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#about-pull-requests) are proposed changes to a repository branch that can be reviewed by a repository's collaborators before being accepted or rejected. 

A pull request references two branches:

- The `base` of a pull request is the branch you intend to change once the proposed changes are merged.
- The `branch` of a pull request represents what you intend the `base` to look like when merged. It is the `base` branch *plus* changes that have been made to it.

## Events and checkout

For each [event type](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows) there is a default `GITHUB_SHA` that will be checked out by the GitHub Actions [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.

The majority of events will default to checking out the "last commit on default branch," which in most cases will be the latest commit on `master`.

The default can be overridden by specifying a `ref` on checkout.

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: develop
```

## How the action works

By default, the action expects to be executed on the pull request `base`&mdash;the branch you intend to modify with the proposed changes.

Workflow steps:

1. Checkout the `base` branch
2. Make changes
3. Execute `create-pull-request` action

The following git diagram shows how the action creates and updates a pull request branch.

## Guidelines

### Providing a consistent base

For the action to work correctly it should be executed in a workflow that checks out a *consistent base* branch. This will be the base of the pull request unless overridden with the `base` input.

This means your workflow should be consistently checking out the branch that you intend to modify once the PR is merged.

In the following example, the [`push`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#push-event-push) and [`create`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#create-event-create) events both trigger the same workflow. This will cause the checkout action to checkout commits from inconsistent branches. Do *not* do this. It will cause multiple pull requests to be created for each additional `base` the action is executed against.

```yml
on:
  push:
  create:
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

Although rare, there may be use cases where it makes sense to execute the workflow on a branch that is not the base of the pull request. In these cases, the base branch can be specified with the `base` action input. The action will attempt to rebase changes made during the workflow on to the actual base.

### Pull request events

Workflows triggered by `pull_request` events will by default check out a [merge commit](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request). To prevent the merge commit being included in created pull requests it is necessary to checkout the `head_ref`.

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

### Restrictions on forked repositories

GitHub Actions have imposed restrictions on events triggered by a forked repository. For example, the `pull_request` event triggered by a fork opening a pull request in the upstream repository.

- Events from forks cannot access secrets, except for for the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
    > With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository.

    [GitHub Actions: Using encrypted secrets in a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow)

- The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has read-only access when an event is triggered by a forked repository.

   [GitHub Actions: Permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token)

These restrictions mean that during a `pull_request` event triggered by a forked repository the action will be unable to commit changes to a branch.

A job condition can be added to prevent workflows from executing when triggered by a repository fork.

```yml
on: pull_request
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Check if the event is not triggered by a fork
    if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
```

### Security

From a security perspective it's good practice to fork third-party actions, review the code, and use your fork of the action in workflows.
By using third-party actions directly the risk exists that it could be modified to do something malicious, such as capturing secrets.

This action uses [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) to compile the Node.js code and dependencies into a single file.
Python dependencies are vendored and committed to the repository [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/tree/master/dist/vendor).
No dependencies are downloaded during the action execution.

Vendored Python dependencies can be reviewed by rebuilding the [dist](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/tree/master/dist) directory and redownloading dependencies.
The following commands require Node and Python 3.

```
npm install
npm run clean
npm run package
```

The `dist` directory should be rebuilt leaving no git diff.

## Advanced usage

### Creating pull requests in a remote repository

Checking out a branch from a different repository from where the workflow is executing will make *that repository* the target for the created pull request. In this case, a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) is required.

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          repository: owner/repo

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
```

### Push using SSH (deploy keys)

[Deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) can be set per repository and so are arguably more secure than using a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
Allowing the action to push with a configured deploy key will trigger `on: push` workflows. This makes it an alternative to using a PAT to trigger checks for pull requests.

How to use SSH (deploy keys) with create-pull-request action:

1. [Create a new SSH key pair](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) for your repository. Do not set a passphrase.
2. Copy the contents of the public key (.pub file) to a new repository [deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) and check the box to "Allow write access."
3. Add a secret to the repository containing the entire contents of the private key.
4. As shown in the example steps below, use the [`webfactory/ssh-agent`](https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent) action to install the private key and clone your repository. Remember to checkout the `base` of your pull request if it's not the default branch, e.g. `git checkout my-branch`.

```yml
    steps:
      - uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.2.0
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - name: Checkout via SSH
        run: git clone git@github.com:peter-evans/create-pull-request.git .

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Push pull request branches to a fork

Instead of pushing pull request branches to the repository you want to update, you can push them to a fork of that repository.
This allows you to employ the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) by using a dedicated user acting as a [machine account](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#3-account-requirements).
This user has no access to the main repository.
It will use their own fork to push code and create the pull request.

1. Create a new GitHub user and login.
2. Fork the repository that you will be creating pull requests in.
3. Create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
4. Logout and log back in to your main user account.
5. Add a secret to your repository containing the above PAT.
6. As shown in the following example workflow, switch the git remote to the fork's URL after checkout and set the action input `request-on-parent` to `true`.

```yaml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - run: |
          git config user.password ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          git remote set-url origin https://github.com/bot-user/fork-project
          git fetch --unshallow -p origin

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          request-on-parent: true
```

### Running in a container

This action can be run inside a container by installing the action's dependencies either in the Docker image itself, or during the workflow.

The action requires `python3`, `pip3` and `git` to be installed and on the `PATH`.

Note that `actions/checkout` requires Git 2.18 or higher to be installed, otherwise it will just download the source of the repository instead of cloning it.

**Alpine container example:**
```yml
jobs:
  createPullRequestAlpine:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: alpine
    steps:
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: apk --no-cache add git python3

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Ubuntu container example:**
```yml
jobs:
  createPullRequestAlpine:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ubuntu
    steps:
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          apt-get update
          apt-get install -y software-properties-common
          add-apt-repository -y ppa:git-core/ppa
          apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip git

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Creating pull requests on tag push

An `on: push` workflow will also trigger when tags are pushed.
During these events, the `actions/checkout` action will check out the `ref/tags/<tag>` git ref by default.
This means the repository will *not* be checked out on an active branch.

If you would like to run `create-pull-request` action on the tagged commit you can achieve this by creating a temporary branch as follows.

```yml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create a temporary tag branch
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'GitHub'
          git config --global user.email 'noreply@github.com'
          git checkout -b temp-${GITHUB_REF:10}
          git push --set-upstream origin temp-${GITHUB_REF:10}

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          base: master

      - name: Delete tag branch
        run: |
          git push --delete origin temp-${GITHUB_REF:10}
```

This is an alternative, simpler workflow to the one above. However, this is not guaranteed to checkout the tagged commit.
There is a chance that in between the tag being pushed and checking out the `master` branch in the workflow, another commit is made to `master`. If that possibility is not a concern, this workflow will work fine.

```yml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: master

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
